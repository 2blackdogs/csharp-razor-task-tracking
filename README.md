# Task Tracking App

### Master Branch

The master branch provides a starting point for the user.  This branch should build and run, and you should be greated with a 404 page in the browser.
There are HTML comments in the main layout file to guide the user for a couple of the steps so they don't have to read through all of the markup to find exact spots.
There are some basic styles applied in site.css so that the required elements will look decent as they work.

### Solution Branch
This branch includes the completed solution.  When you run the application you should be able to create tasks in a database and view them on the home page.  You should also be able to navigate between pages.
